## Code refraction
I was giving the opertunity to work with the to refract their code and make sure their was not redundent code to improve their sites performance while also changing html elements so it could easily confrm to the standards needed to cater to those with disabilities

## changes
i've consolidated moste of the css down to fewer lines as there were many repeated variables that could have been grouped together.

# html
found that the "<a>" variable needed its own text color as outlined in the code as well

# css
moved other styles to the body section as they were already attempted to be applied to all text and the few acceptions were already overwriting this. examples include
> background-color
> font-family
> font-size
> color
