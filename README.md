Horiseon's front end to show you their advertised statagies and the benefits that come with choosing them, do they fit your needs?

### Code refraction
I was giving the opertunity to work with the to refract their code and make sure their was not redundent code to improve their sites performance while also changing html elements so it could easily confrm to the standards needed to cater to those with disabilities

## changes
i've consolidated moste of the css down to fewer lines as there were many repeated variables that could have been grouped together.

### html
made a `header` element to replace `div class="header"`

made a `nav` element to house the navigation option in the header

changed `div`s into `sections`

added `articles` for `search engine optimization`/`online reputation management`/`social medai marketing`

made the `benifits` section an `aside` instead of a `dive` for better readability.

### css

moved other styles to the body section as they were already attempted to be applied to all text and the few acceptions were already overwriting this. examples include
>`background-color`
`font-family` 
`font-size` 
`color`
